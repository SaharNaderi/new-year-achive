Happy New Year! As we start a new year, I am excited to announce that I am offering a certificate in UX design in my free time. I believe in investing in myself and am always eager to learn and research new things. As part of my certification process, I will be conducting research on the latest UX design trends and techniques. I am thrilled to be able to share my knowledge and skills with others, and I hope to make a positive impact in the field of UX design through my work."
